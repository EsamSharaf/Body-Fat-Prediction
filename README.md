# Body-Fat-Prediction

This task aims for predicting body fat percentage from a group of input features. Measuring fat percentage requires many body measurements. This is an attempt to build a model based on the input data to estimate the Body Fat with the sufficient number of features to do that, which could make fat percentage estimation more convenient.

The dataset comprises a set of features of 252 men (i.e. samples) in order to estimate Body Fat Percentage. The number of features is 13; 12 as input features and one (BodyFat) as target variable.
